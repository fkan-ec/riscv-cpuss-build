This file describes the steps for building CPUSS images.

1) Setup environment
export RISCV=<toolchain-dir>/riscv64

2) Clone riscv-cpuss-build
git clone --recursive https://github.com/fkan-ec/riscv-cpuss-build

3) Copy cpuss patch tar
cd riscv-cpuss-build
cp riscv_cpuss_patch_1.0.0.tgz .
tar xzf riscv_cpuss_patch_1.0.0.tgz

4) Apply patches
make apply_patch

5) Build

5a) Default for Xilinx FPGA
make all

5b) For AWS FPGA
make BUILD_TARGET=AWS_FPGA all

Two files are created in fit_image directory:

fw_payload.bin  -- Binary for opensbi and u-boot
image_xlinx.itb -- FIT image for kernel, fs and dts
